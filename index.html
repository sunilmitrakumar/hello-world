<p> I'm an economist at the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/kii/" target="_blank">King's India Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/did/" target="_blank">Department of International Development</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's College London</a>. I work on questions of causal inference in development using observational data, particularly in the context of discrimination. </p>

<p>I received my PhD in Economics from the University of East Anglia, MA in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics, and BA (Hons.) in Mathematics from St. Stephen’s College, Delhi University. Before embarking on my PhD I worked for the Social Initiatives Group of ICICI Bank, an erstwhile major funder of non-profit activities in India.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: The use of computers has revolutionised our ability to learn about ourselves and the world around us. Beyond the goal of performance or prediction, the extent to which machine actions and algorithms are explainable and intelligible to human beings - Explainable AI - are increasingly becoming important, especially so in socio-economic contexts, and where life and health outcomes are involved. While the Turing test aims to distinguish between machine and human, Judea Pearl’s ‘mini’ Turing test focuses on one crucial aspect of this distinction: the ability to reason causally and thereby answer causal queries based on counterfactuals. At the heart of counterfactual-based reasoning lies the role of causal expla- nation, or delineating the underlying causal mechanisms. In this chapter we make a small step towards demonstrating how causal models can be brought to observational data to answer useful counterfactual queries in contexts where complex social processes are at play. We estimate the causal effects of education on female labour-force participation in India in a causal mediation framework. We consider the role of positive assortative marital-matching in terms of education which leads to husbands’ levels of education mediating the effect of women’s education on their subsequent labour force participation, and we use a g-formula based approach to estimate the total causal and natural direct effect of education.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: This essay provides a thematic discussion of discrimination in credit. Through a selective review of the literature I illustrate that caste, gender and race are all persistent axes of discrimination in credit, and that discrimination has been shown to exist across diverse contexts. I examine the main conceptual tools used in this literature to shed light on the causal mechanisms that lead to discrimination, and in particular attempt to delineate the role of individuals, institutions and formal regulation. By briefly exploring the links between discrimination in credit and group-based inequality in other arenas of economy and society, I argue why the implications of the former extend far beyond credit alone, and are a powerful force in shaping inequality more generally including across generations. </span></p>

The structure of a system and its dynamics can influence each other through feedback effects. In this paper we offer a brief survey of how structure plays a role in dynamic economic theory – in particular, growth and business cycles. We propose a morphogenetic framework, inspired from the creation of forms in developmental biology, as a potential unifying approach for studying economic structures and their dynamics. We synthesise insights from three different strands of research, focusing on the role of coupling, diffusion and symmetry-breaking. We highlight their existing and prospective links with economics.

We find that the effect of birth order is negative, and a variety of endogeneity and robustness checks suggest a causal interpretation of this finding. We then examine whether these effects vary across households’ economic status, and we find significant heterogeneity across absolute as well as relative standards of living, operationalized as household wealth and relative deprivation. Finally, we find that firstborns’ advantage is amplified when they are male, and in particular when other siblings are female.

We investigate whether banks practice taste-based discrimination on the basis of caste. In order to identify potential discrimination, we consider loan applications and approval decisions separately. We find significant inter-caste differences in application rates, and evidence of discrimination against Scheduled Tribe borrowers at the approval stage. To rule out the role of statistical discrimination, we simulate unobserved credit histories with various distributions. Evidence for taste-based discrimination persists despite accounting for unobservables. However, we find that this discrimination does not affect small farmers. </span></p>

Recent research shows that the gap in learning achievement between private and government schools in India can be explained away by self-selection. Analysing four rounds of panel data and distinguishing between ‘knowing’ and ‘applying’ dimensions of maths learning, I find that there is no private school advantage in the applying domain but that there is an advantage in the knowing domain.

This paper considers the application of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to improve public systems in developing countries. Arguing that existing critiques of RCTs as to problems with extrapolation and narrowness of scope are especially relevant in this context, I consider the claim that these shortcomings can be ameliorated through better causal explanations. I analyse how theoretical mathematical models are used to construct causal explanations, and argue that it is still difficult to extrapolate or address the subjectivity inherent in the choice of interventions. I illustrate these arguments using two prominent RCTs that have trialled interventions to improve government schools in India.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(7)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_7"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_7" style="display:none;">: 

This paper analyzes whether caste impedes access to formal agricultural credit in India. Credit is provided mainly through cooperative and commercial banks. Using national data, we find that cooperative banks discriminate against lower caste borrowers, and find weak evidence that commercial banks instead bias lending in their favor in accordance with affirmative action policies. We compare the organizational structures of the two types of bank, and explain discrimination by cooperative banks in terms of interest group capture at the district level by showing that discrimination takes place in those districts where higher castes dominate.
