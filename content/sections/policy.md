My work on **Payment by Results** in International Development has helped shaped policy and practice, especially in the UK. This happened somewhat by accident, with relevant academic papers leading to consultancy work, which now lead to more academic papers. For a quick introduction to my thinking for a general audience, see:

- My [first](https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/payment-by-results-what-is-the-evidence-from-the-first-decade/) and [second](https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/payment-by-results-in-aid-whats-new/) posts on Duncan Green's From Poverty to Power blog

**Conceptual Basis for Payment by Results in International Development, 2013-2014**
For DFID UK, a review of the conceptual basis for Payment by Results. This examines theoretically and conceptually new aid modalities. It deals with the interaction between donor and recipient,  and makes use of relevant behavioural insights. (c. 20 days). There are several relevant outputs:

- [the main technical paper](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a089bb40f0b64974000230/61214-The_Conceptual_Basis_of_Payment_by_Results_FinalReport_P1.pdf) (co-authored with Arjan Verschoor),

**Evaluating Development Impact Bonds, 2014**
For DFID UK, [a study on Development Impact Bonds (DIBs)](https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/evaluating-development-impact-bonds-a-study-for-dfid). The first half of the report looks at their conceptual nature, using economic theory and related evidence (e.g. Social Impact Bonds, which have a longer history). The second half of the report looks at how they can be evaluated. Joint with Roger Drew. (30 days.)

**International Aid and Domestic Tax Revenue, 2013-14**
Following my 2011 publication examining the effects of aid grants and loans on domestic tax revenue, I returned to the subject for ICTD. The aim of the project was to investigate the source of contradictory results, predominately regarding aid grants, and led to a publication in the *World Bank Research Observer* (c. 80 days).

**Aid and Government Spending, 2010-2011**
Through CREDIT, the School of Economics, University of Nottingham. The work was for the AFD (L’Agence Française de Développement), and included 3 reports, which are currently not publicly available. My input was econometric. (c. 80 days)
